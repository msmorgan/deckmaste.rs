# Skill conformance tables — the P0 progress meter

Concept-by-concept parity between the mtg-rules skill's reference docs
(pinned baseline: docs/rules-taxonomy.md §10) and deckmaste, maintained by
the P0 alignment effort (docs/todo.md priority 0). One row per skill
concept; statuses:

- **✓** — grammar exists in core (engine behavior may still be a seam).
- **partial** — some of the concept's fields/cases exist; the gap is named.
- **MISSING (P0.W*n*)** — no grammar yet; tagged with the master plan's wave.
- **engine-seam** — grammar complete; consumption is a tagged `todo!`
  (post-P0 conversion backlog; inventory: `rg 'todo!\("P0\.' crates/`).

Each P0 wave updates its rows on completion. P0's exit criterion: every
remaining non-✓ row reads **engine-seam**.

## 1. Predicates & selectors (`queries.md` §1–2 ↔ `Filter`/`TargetSpec`/`Selection`)

| exactly-N / up-to-N / any-number selection | `Quantity::{Exactly, AtMost, AnyNumber, …}` | ✓ |
