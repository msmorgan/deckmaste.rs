# Skill conformance tables — the P0 progress meter

Concept-by-concept parity between the mtg-rules skill's reference docs
(pinned baseline: docs/rules-taxonomy.md §10) and deckmaste, maintained by
the P0 alignment effort (docs/todo.md priority 0). One row per skill
concept; statuses:

- **✓** — grammar exists in core (engine behavior may still be a seam).
- **partial** — some of the concept's fields/cases exist; the gap is named.
- **MISSING (P0.W*n*)** — no grammar yet; tagged with the master plan's wave.
- **engine-seam** — grammar complete; consumption is a tagged `todo!`
  (post-P0 conversion backlog; inventory: `rg 'todo!\("P0\.' crates/`).

Each P0 wave updates its rows on completion. P0's exit criterion: every
remaining non-✓ row reads **engine-seam**.

## 1. Predicates & selectors (`queries.md` §1–2 ↔ `Filter`/`TargetSpec`/`Selection`)

| skill concept | deckmaste | status |
|---|---|---|
| zone-change master event (object, from, to, position, face, cause) | core `Event::ZoneMove`; engine `ZoneWillChange`/`ZoneChanged` | partial — `face` + `cause` fields MISSING (P0.W3/W6) |

| replaced events never trigger; look-back-in-time triggers | `ZoneWillChange` stage + LKI snapshots | ✓ (engine) |

## 3. Decision kinds (`choices.md` §2–4 ↔ engine `PendingDecision`/`Action`)

| skill concept | deckmaste | status |
|---|---|---|
| modes of a spell / activated ability (announce-locked) | `PendingDecision::ChooseModes` shell | ✓ schema; surfacing engine-seam |
| cost intentions: alternative/additional, X, splice, hybrid/Phyrexian | `CostChange::Additional`, `AlternativeCost` grammar | ✓ grammar; the announce DECISION kinds remain MISSING (P0.W3) |

| division / distribution among targets | `PendingDecision::Division` shell | ✓ schema; surfacing engine-seam |
| triggered-ability modes/targets at stack-put | targets only | partial (P0.W3) |

| decider field (other-player choosers) | `DeciderSpec` via `DecisionPoint` | ✓ |

| randomness as pseudo-decider (flip/roll kinds) | `DeciderSpec::Rng`; flip/roll verbs + events | ✓ grammar; execution engine-seam |

## 4. Temporal & deontic modifiers (`temporal.md`, `deontics.md` §2–3 ↔ `temporal.rs`/`deontic.rs`)

| skill concept | deckmaste | status |
|---|---|---|
| four polarities over typed actions (May/Cant/Must/Gate) | `Deontic` over `DeonticAction` | ✓ grammar; legality evaluation is engine-seam (P0.W1 presence guards live in `legal.rs`) |
| resolution Toll (price bites at resolution) | `Effect::Unless` (named the Toll node) | ✓ |
| Only window refinement — activation timing | `ActivatedAbility.window` | ✓ grammar; InstantSpeed/SorcerySpeed evaluated, other windows engine-seam |
| cast-permission window (flash-style May rows) | `DeonticAction::Cast { window }` | ✓ grammar; consumption engine-seam (cast guard) |
| AsThough premises (scoped counterfactuals) | `StaticEffect::AsThough` (`SpendManaAsAnyColor` + macros) | partial — premises accrete; consumption engine-seam |
| shared Window vocabulary, reading per position | `Window` (speeds, ThisTurn, DuringTurn, DuringStep) | ✓ |

| `started` latch, never-started/already-ended edges | engine effect-instance record | engine-seam (arrives with ForAsLongAs tracking) |
| lock-point axis on stored values | `LockPoint` (8 points) | ✓ type; threading is P0.W2/W3 |
| once-per-turn limiter scopes (object vs controller) | `UseLimit::{OncePerTurn, OncePerGame}` | partial — controller-scoped trigger flavor needs a scope distinction (P0.W3) |

## 5. Costs & mana (`costs.md`, `mana.md` ↔ `cost.rs`/`mana.rs`/`continuous.rs`)

| skill concept | deckmaste | status |
|---|---|---|
| printed mana cost / activation cost positions | face `mana_cost`; `ActivatedAbility.cost` | ✓ |
| additional costs, mandatory + optional/kicker (pipeline-positional) | `CostChange::Additional { components, optional }` | ✓ grammar; pipeline application engine-seam |

| symbol vocabulary, cost-side (generic, colored, {C}, X, hybrid, Phyrexian, snow) | `ManaSymbol` complete | ✓ grammar; payment evaluates simple symbols only — X/hybrid/Phyrexian/snow spells are never OFFERED (scoped absence, engine-seam) |
| {0} vs no-mana-cost ([CR#118.5..118.6]) | `[]` = absent/unpayable (can_cast gate); `[Generic(0)]` = {0} | ✓ |
| alternative unlocks an unpayable base ([CR#118.6a]) | grammar ✓ | engine-seam |
| multi-way symbol announce timing ([CR#118.13]) | — | MISSING (P0.W3 decision schema) |
| mana unit schema: type + source snapshot + riders + persistence | `ManaProduction`/`ManaRider` grammar; pool = six counts | ✓ grammar; pool units engine-seam (production guard live in `resolve.rs`) |
| spend restrictions / on-spend effects / on-spend triggers / persistence | `ManaRider::{SpendOnly, GrantOnSpend, TriggerOnSpend, Persistent}` | ✓ grammar |
| production-side symbol readings (hybrid choice, Phyrexian color, generic→colorless) | `ManaSpec` | ✓ |
| undefined-type production = no mana; "could produce" ([CR#106.7]) | — | MISSING (engine query, post-P0) |
| mana abilities never forced; no auto-tap | explicit-choice policy | ✓ |
| mana abilities mid-payment ([CR#601.2g]) | — | MISSING (P0.W3 decision flow) |
| payment as transactional batch + [CR#733.1] rewind | — | MISSING (P0.W3 cause-tagged event batches) |
| pool empties per step/phase; per-unit persistence override | `ManaEmptied` turn-based action | ✓ engine; override engine-seam |
