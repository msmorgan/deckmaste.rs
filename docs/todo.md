# Modern-support TODO catalog

2026-06-10. The gap between what the engine, grammar, and card pipeline support
today and what *every Modern-legal card and mechanic* needs. Census source: the
local MTGJSON snapshot (22,050 distinct Modern-legal card names) intersected
with the Scryfall keyword catalogs; rules references are the CR snapshot in
`data/rules/`. "Cards" columns count distinct Modern-legal card names that use
a mechanic — use them to prioritize. Mechanic names only in this census; the
policy on committing real cards (the ~100–200-card canon slice, hand-written
edge cases) is `card-data.md`.

Already in place, for orientation: the full turn/priority/stack loop, casting
with mana payment and targets, zone-change pipeline with LKI, core combat with
seven native keywords (the true intrinsics first/double strike, deathtouch,
trample, plus flying, vigilance, lifelink), layers 4–7 with timestamps and CDAs, zone-move /
step / attacking triggers, a handful of SBAs, the core grammar on a combined
`SupportsMacros` derive, and an extract→resolve→graduate card pipeline with
mana/keyword/spell/triggered parsers.

## Priorities

When picking "the next" item, work down this ordering: take the highest tier
that has an unclaimed, non-conflicting item; within a tier, use the "Cards"
counts. This is an ordering, not an exclusion list, and it is not exhaustive —
anything unlisted (e.g. §10 format/runner) ranks below these unless the user
says otherwise.

0. **Skill alignment, core-first** — full conceptual alignment with the
   mtg-rules skill (pinned baseline, docs/rules-taxonomy.md §10): every
   skill-named concept lands as complete grammar in `deckmaste_core`; the
   engine gets tagged `todo!("P0.W<n>: …")` seams (presence guards where a
   concept is currently silently ignored), never behavior. Eight waves
   (W0 conformance rails → W7 ADR sweep), each wave = design dialogue +
   its own sub-plan before code. Master plan:
   docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-11-p0-skill-alignment-master.md.
   Seam backlog query: `rg 'todo!\("P0\.' crates/`.
1. **Engine happy path** — the engine supports the normal resolution path of
   ~90% of MTG abilities (§3, plus whichever §2 grammar that path needs).
2. **Oracle-text coverage** — extraction and parsers graduate an increasing
   subset of oracle text (§9 parsers, §4 layouts).
3. **Keyword authoring** — keyword abilities, keyword actions, and ability
   words get real macro bodies (§6–§8).
4. **Convenience macros** — shared macros for common mechanics (intertwined
   with 2 and 3).
5. **Noncanon tests** — keep the noncanon suite growing alongside engine work.
6. **Performance** — optimization passes.

## How to claim an item (instructions for agents)

When starting work on a todo item:

1. **Make a new jj change in `default@` marking the item in-progress.**
   In the default workspace: `jj new`, then tick the item's checkbox from
   `- [ ]` to `- [x]`; for a table row (no checkbox), prefix its first cell
   with `WIP:`. Then `jj describe -m "todo: claim <slug>"`.
2. **Bookmark that change:** `jj bookmark create <slug> -r @`.
3. **Start a new workspace** on that bookmark for the actual work:
   `jj workspace add --name <slug> -r <slug> ../deckmaste.<slug>`, then do the
   shared-dir setup from CLAUDE.md ("New jj workspaces") before building.

A ticked box / `WIP:` prefix means claimed and in progress — pick the
highest-priority (see Priorities) unclaimed item that doesn't conflict with
the claimed ones (same files, same engine subsystem, or one item's right
column naming the other). Claim bookmarks carry
the item's slug, so `jj bookmark list` shows what's active. Items leave this
file only when their work lands in the default line.

Bullets carry an explicit `slug`; for table rows derive it from the mechanic
name (`kw-…` for keyword abilities, `ka-…` for keyword actions, `aw-…` for
ability words), e.g. `kw-split-second`. Items tagged **[design]** require a
design dialogue with the user before implementation — claiming one means
opening that conversation, not coding solo. All CLAUDE.md jj constraints apply
in full.

## 1. Parked work to integrate

- [ ] `tokens-design` — token extraction parked twice (`tokens-shelved`,
  `tokens-revived` bookmarks). Blocked on a keyword-defs design the user has
  not yet approved. **[design]**

## 2. Core grammar gaps

- [ ] `core-loyalty-costs` — a loyalty-cost component (+N / −N / −X) for activated
  abilities; prerequisite for 1,512 planeswalker faces.
- [ ] `core-alt-costs` — first-class shape (or blessed macro convention) for
  alternative and additional casting costs: flashback, evoke, overload,
  madness, kicker, etc., including "if the X cost was paid" linkage.
  **[design]**
- [ ] `core-card-shapes` — `Card` variants beyond `Normal`/`ModalDfc` (see §4).
- [ ] `core-copy-grammar` — copy effects: spell copies on the stack, token copies,
  enters-as-a-copy, "becomes a copy of" (layer 1 input).
- [ ] `core-emblems` — emblem declarations and command-zone object grammar.
- [ ] `core-saga-chapters` — chapter-ability structure (I/II/III markers, ranges,
  read-ahead compatibility).
- [ ] `core-as-enters-choices` — "as this enters, choose …" (color/type/number/
  opponent) with stored, linked choices readable by other abilities.
- [ ] `core-casting-restrictions` — "can't be countered", split-second-style stack
  lockout, "cast only …" timing/permission restrictions.
- [ ] `core-count-query` — `Count::Query` bridge to engine-tracked tallies (storm
  count, lands played, cards drawn); aggregate sums (devotion-style) still
  unsolved. **[design]**
- [ ] `core-intrinsic-keywords-policy` — which keywords graduate from plugin
  macros to intrinsic `KeywordAbility` variants, and the template-param story
  for parameterized ones (ward, protection, typed cycling). **[design]**

## 3. Engine machinery

### Resolution breadth (`crates/deckmaste_engine/src/resolve.rs` todo!s)

- [x] `engine-resolve-playeractions` — resolve the remaining `PlayerAction`s:
  GainLife, Discard, AddMana, Create, Sacrifice, Exile, Untap, PutInLibrary
  (verb landed, resolution still todo).
- [ ] `engine-resolve-actions` — resolve `Destroy` (regeneration/indestructible
  aware) and `ReturnToHand`.
- [ ] `engine-resolve-effects` — May, If/Unless, ForEach, Modal, Delayed,
  Reflexive effect frames; resolution-time choices surfaced as decisions.
- [ ] `engine-resolve-counts` — X, CountOf(Filter), StatOf, ThatMuch.
- [ ] `engine-resolve-selections` — Choose/Random selections as surfaced
  decisions; remaining `Reference` variants (Bound, Linked, ControllerOf,
  OwnerOf, attachment refs).
- [ ] `engine-filter-breadth` — evaluate Named, Stat, Relation (controller/owner/
  opponent/attached), StateFilter (Status, HasCounter, HasDesignation,
  RelatedBy), and Ref(Reference) filters (`target.rs`, `trigger.rs` snapshot
  matching).

### Triggers and conditions (`trigger.rs`)

- [ ] `engine-trigger-events` — match the remaining event shapes: Performed
  (verb-based: sacrificed, discarded, milled…), DamageDealt, spell-cast,
  becomes-tapped/untapped, becomes-blocked (needs once-per-attacker dedup),
  becomes-targeted (prerequisite for ward/heroic), OneOfEvents.

  "if" rechecked on resolution [CR#603.4].
- [ ] `engine-trigger-limits` — OncePerTurn and friends.
- [ ] `engine-history-tallies` — turn/game history the condition layer can query:
  spells cast this turn (storm), lands played, life lost/gained, permanents
  that left, "entered this turn", attack/cast ordinals. The Tallies registry
  exists; wire it broadly and extend `Window` beyond ThisTurn.

### Layers and continuous effects (`layer.rs` seams)

- [ ] `engine-layers-1-3` — layer 1 copy, layer 2 control change, layer 3 text
  change; face-down characteristics; dependency ordering [CR#613.8].

  scope resolution (currently locked empty), subtype changes in layer 4 with
  confers data, become-basic-land-type, base loyalty/defense.

  legend rule, token-ceases-to-exist, battle with no defense, spell-copy
  cleanup.
- [ ] `engine-counters-api` — add/remove/move counters as events; enters-with-
  counters; +1/+1 vs −1/−1 annihilation SBA; keyword-counter payload registry
  [CR#122.1] (stun, shield, finality, flying, …).

### Replacements and prevention (`replace.rs`)

- [ ] `engine-replacements` — a general replacement registry beyond enters-tapped:
  Instead/Skip/Also, zone-destination redirects, enters-with-counters,
  enters-as-choices, draw replacements (dredge/miracle window), dies→exile,
  lifegain/damage modification, self-replacement ordering.
- [ ] `engine-prevention` — prevention shields and windows [CR#615.1], including
  "can't be prevented".

### Costs and casting (`cast.rs`, `legal.rs`)

- [ ] `engine-cost-payment` — hybrid/Phyrexian payment choices, snow, life
  payment, non-mana additional costs (sacrifice/discard/exile/tap others).
- [ ] `engine-cost-modification` — apply CostModifier statics in the cost
  calculation pipeline [CR#601.2f] (affinity, convoke, improvise, delve,
  reducers/taxers).
- [ ] `engine-alt-costs` — choosing an alternative cost at announcement; "without
  paying its mana cost" (cascade, suspend, plot).
- [x] `engine-activated-abilities` — activating non-mana abilities (only mana
  abilities are legal today, `legal.rs`): general costs, timing restrictions
  ("only as a sorcery", once-per-turn, once-per-game), loyalty abilities.
- [ ] `engine-mana-system` — mana pool provenance/riders (spend-only-on
  restrictions, doesn't-empty), triggered mana abilities, conditional
  production.
- [ ] `engine-cast-from-zones` — casting from graveyard/exile/library via
  permissions; linked "the exiled card" access; timing windows (miracle,
  forecast).

### Zones and objects

- [ ] `engine-exile-command` — wire Exile (face-up/face-down, with counters,
  linked retrieval) and Command zones as zone-pipeline sources/destinations.
- [x] `engine-tokens` — resolve Create; token objects on the battlefield; token
  copies; predefined tokens (Treasure, Food, Clue, Blood, Map, Powerstone,
  Incubator, Role); token SBA on zone leave.
- [ ] `engine-copy-spells` — spell copies on the stack with target re-choice
  (storm, replicate, casualty, conspire, magecraft sources).
- [ ] `engine-attachments` — attach/unattach state, enchant/equip legality
  checks, aura cast targeting, attach SBAs, equip/reconfigure/fortify

  transforms-with-day-night, meld pairs).
- [ ] `engine-phasing` — phasing status and untap-step phasing events.

### Combat

- [ ] `engine-combat-restrictions` — enforce evasion/restriction statics in
  attack/block legality: flying/reach, menace, fear/intimidate/shadow/skulk,
  landwalk, defender, "can't attack/block", protection-from in blocking.
- [ ] `engine-combat-requirements` — must-attack/must-block requirements, goad,
  attack taxes/costs.
- [ ] `engine-multi-defender` — attack targets per attacker (player, planeswalker,
  battle) and per-defender damage routing.

### Turn, game, determinism

- [ ] `engine-turn-modification` — extra turns, extra combat/main phases, skip
  steps/phases, "end the turn".
- [ ] `engine-win-alterations` — can't-lose/can't-win statics, alternate win/loss
  effects, restart-the-game, controlling another player's turn. **[design]**
- [ ] `engine-randomness` — seeded shuffle, coin flips, random discard; keep runs
  reproducible for the sim harness.

## 4. Card shapes (layouts)

Extraction currently reads `normal` and `modal_dfc` only; each row needs
grammar (§2 `core-card-shapes`), extraction, and engine behavior. Slug:

## 8. Ability words

Ability words carry no rules weight; the work is (a) one umbrella parser item
and (b) the condition/history machinery the marked abilities lean on (mostly
`engine-history-tallies`, `engine-trigger-events`, `engine-trigger-conditions`).
Rows here track that the *patterns* graduate. Slug: `aw-<kebab-case>`.

- [ ] `aw-prefix-parsing` — strip "Ability word —" prefixes during extraction and
  preserve them for rendering.

| Ability word | Cards | Leans on |
|---|---|---|
| Landfall | 583 | land-ETB trigger (exists) |
| Delirium | 186 | graveyard card-type census |
| Domain | 106 | basic-land-type census |
| Start your engines! | 97 | `engine-speed` |
| Channel | 94 | discard-activated from hand |

## 9. Pipeline and parsers

- [x] `parse-activated` — activated-ability frame (`cost: effect`), including the
  cost grammar; registry slot exists, parser doesn't.
- [ ] `parse-static` — static-prose abilities (gets/has/can't sentences) into
  Continuously/StaticEffect.
- [ ] `parse-replacement` — "if … would …, instead …" / "as … enters" /
  "… enters tapped" templates.
- [ ] `parse-modal` — "Choose one —" bullet lists, escalate/spree-style modal
  costs.
- [ ] `parse-filters` — natural-language object descriptions to Filter ASTs
  beyond the current handful (control/zone/type/stat qualifiers).
- [ ] `macro-keyword-templates` — template parameters for keyword macros
  (ward cost, protection quality, typed cycling) so the ~190 keyword stubs
  can expand per-card.
- [x] `macro-subtype-params` — subtype macro registers under its printed-string
  argument, not its filename; parametric subtype refs miss it and their cards
  stall as todos. Needs the template-param refactor.
- [ ] `macro-keyword-actions` — implement the 66 keyword-action macro stubs over
  engine primitives.
- [ ] `pipeline-fixpoint` — dependency-ordered re-graduation (subtypes → keywords
  → cards) instead of today's single pass.
- [ ] `pipeline-layout-extraction` — extract layouts beyond normal/modal_dfc
  (see §4).
- [ ] `canon-slice` — grow `plugins/canon/` toward the ~100–200-card mechanics
  slice (`card-data.md`): as each mechanic lands, graduate a few real cards
  exercising it; hand-write (and mark) the genuinely unparseable ones.
- [ ] `macro-param-validation` — type-check macro params (Color, Filter, …) at
  the graduate gate.
- [ ] `tokens-templates` — token definitions (predefined + ad-hoc) and granted
  quoted abilities; resume from the parked bookmarks (§1). **[design]**

## 10. Format and runner

- [ ] `format-deck-validation` — Modern deck legality: banlist via mtgjson
  legalities (derived data only), 4-of rule, sideboard size.
- [ ] `runner-outside-game` — sideboard/outside-the-game access (companion,
  Lesson fetch, wish-style effects).
- [ ] `runner-hidden-info` — per-player redaction stays a runner-layer projection
  by design (core is full-information). The face-down mechanics in §6 are the
  forcing function; revisit the boundary then. **[design]**
