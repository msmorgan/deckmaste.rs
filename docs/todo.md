# Modern-support TODO catalog

2026-06-10. The gap between what the engine, grammar, and card pipeline support
today and what *every Modern-legal card and mechanic* needs. Census source: the
local MTGJSON snapshot (22,050 distinct Modern-legal card names) intersected
with the Scryfall keyword catalogs; rules references are the CR snapshot in
`data/rules/`. "Cards" columns count distinct Modern-legal card names that use
a mechanic — use them to prioritize. Mechanic names only in this census; the
policy on committing real cards (the ~100–200-card canon slice, hand-written
edge cases) is `card-data.md`.

Already in place, for orientation: the full turn/priority/stack loop, casting
with mana payment and targets, zone-change pipeline with LKI, core combat with
seven native keywords (the true intrinsics first/double strike, deathtouch,
trample, plus flying, vigilance, lifelink), layers 4–7 with timestamps and CDAs, zone-move /
step / attacking triggers, a handful of SBAs, the core grammar on a combined
`SupportsMacros` derive, and an extract→resolve→graduate card pipeline with
mana/keyword/spell/triggered parsers.

## Priorities

When picking "the next" item, work down this ordering: take the highest tier
that has an unclaimed, non-conflicting item; within a tier, use the "Cards"
counts. This is an ordering, not an exclusion list, and it is not exhaustive —
anything unlisted (e.g. §10 format/runner) ranks below these unless the user
says otherwise.

0. ~~**Skill alignment, core-first**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-06-12** (all eight
   waves done; meter: docs/conformance.md). What remains of it lives in
   two named backlogs, picked up under the priorities below: the SEAM
   inventory (`rg 'todo!\("P0\.' crates/` — convert to behavior, mostly
   priority 1) and the post-P0 GRAMMAR backlog (conformance rows tagged
   "post-P0 grammar backlog" — each needs a design dialogue first).
1. **Engine happy path** — the engine supports the normal resolution path of
   ~90% of MTG abilities (§3, plus whichever §2 grammar that path needs).
2. **Oracle-text coverage** — extraction and parsers graduate an increasing
   subset of oracle text (§9 parsers, §4 layouts).
3. **Keyword authoring** — keyword abilities, keyword actions, and ability
   words get real macro bodies (§6–§8).
4. **Convenience macros** — shared macros for common mechanics (intertwined
   with 2 and 3).
5. **Noncanon tests** — keep the noncanon suite growing alongside engine work.
6. **Performance** — optimization passes.

## How to claim an item (instructions for agents)

When starting work on a todo item:

1. **Make a new jj change in `default@` marking the item in-progress.**
   In the default workspace: `jj new`, then tick the item's checkbox from
   `- [ ]` to `- [x]`; for a table row (no checkbox), prefix its first cell
   with `WIP:`. Then `jj describe -m "todo: claim <slug>"`.
2. **Bookmark that change:** `jj bookmark create <slug> -r @`.
3. **Start a new workspace** on that bookmark for the actual work:
   `jj workspace add --name <slug> -r <slug> ../deckmaste.<slug>`, then do the
   shared-dir setup from CLAUDE.md ("New jj workspaces") before building.

A ticked box / `WIP:` prefix means claimed and in progress — pick the
highest-priority (see Priorities) unclaimed item that doesn't conflict with
the claimed ones (same files, same engine subsystem, or one item's right
column naming the other). Claim bookmarks carry
the item's slug, so `jj bookmark list` shows what's active. Items leave this
file only when their work lands in the default line.

Bullets carry an explicit `slug`; for table rows derive it from the mechanic
name (`kw-…` for keyword abilities, `ka-…` for keyword actions, `aw-…` for
ability words), e.g. `kw-split-second`. Items tagged **[design]** require a
design dialogue with the user before implementation — claiming one means
opening that conversation, not coding solo. All CLAUDE.md jj constraints apply
in full.

## 1. Parked work to integrate

- [ ] `tokens-design` — token extraction parked twice (`tokens-shelved`,
  `tokens-revived` bookmarks). Blocked on a keyword-defs design the user has
  not yet approved. **[design]**

## 2. Core grammar gaps

- [ ] `core-loyalty-costs` — a loyalty-cost component (+N / −N / −X) for activated
  abilities; prerequisite for 1,512 planeswalker faces.
- [ ] `core-alt-costs` — the SHAPES landed in P0.W2 (`AlternativeCost` on
  `May(Cast(cost: …))`, `CostChange::Additional{optional}`); remaining: the
  keyword macros over them (flashback, evoke, overload, madness, kicker)
  and "if the X cost was paid" linkage. **[design]**
- [ ] `core-card-shapes` — `Card` variants beyond `Normal`/`ModalDfc` (see §4).
- [ ] `core-copy-grammar` — copy effects: `CopySpell` (copy-on-stack) landed
  P0.W4; remaining: cast-a-copy ([CR#707.12], decides UD-4), token copies,
  enters-as-a-copy, "becomes a copy of" (layer 1 input).
- [ ] `core-emblems` — `GetEmblem(Vec<Ability>)` + `ObjectKind::Emblem`
  landed in P0.W5; remaining: engine minting (the P0.W5 resolve seam) and
  the parser/macro story for "you get an emblem with …".
- [ ] `core-saga-chapters` — chapter-ability structure (I/II/III markers, ranges,
  read-ahead compatibility).
- [ ] `core-as-enters-choices` — "as this enters, choose …" (color/type/number/
  opponent) with stored, linked choices readable by other abilities.
- [ ] `core-casting-restrictions` — "can't be countered" and split-second-style
  stack lockout; "cast only …" timing landed in P0.W1
  (`DeonticAction::Cast{window}` — consumption is the engine seam).
- [ ] `core-count-query` — `Count::Query(QueryKey)` landed in P0.W4
  (CardsDrawn/LandsPlayed evaluate live; StormCount is a seam); remaining:
  more keys as cards force them, and aggregate sums (devotion-style) still
  unsolved. **[design]**
- [ ] `core-intrinsic-keywords-policy` — which keywords graduate from plugin
  macros to intrinsic `KeywordAbility` variants, and the template-param story
  for parameterized ones (ward, protection, typed cycling). **[design]**

## 3. Engine machinery

### Resolution breadth (`crates/deckmaste_engine/src/resolve.rs` todo!s)

- [x] `engine-resolve-playeractions` — resolve the remaining `PlayerAction`s:
  GainLife, Discard, AddMana, Create, Sacrifice, Exile, Untap, PutInLibrary
  (verb landed, resolution still todo).
- [x] `engine-resolve-actions` — `Destroy` resolves since P0.W7. `ReturnToHand`
  (selection → owner's hand from its current zone, [CR#400.7]), `Counter`
  (spell → owner's graveyard, [CR#701.6a]), and the `WillDestroy` intent now
  land. `WillDestroy` is the replaceable destruction event ([CR#701.8a]): the
  `Destroy` action AND the lethal-damage SBA emit it, and its apply drops the
  destroy for an object carrying a destruction-replacement static
  (indestructible, [CR#702.12b]) else commits the Bf→Gy move — the loud
  kw-indestructible SBA guard is retired (canon: Darksteel Myr). Residual
  seams: a countered ABILITY's cessation (narrowed `todo!` — abilities aren't
  cards, [CR#701.6a]) and regeneration's one-shot shield (the `WillDestroy`
  hook is live; the shield rides `engine-replacements`).
- [ ] `engine-counter-ability` — a countered triggered/activated ability ceases
  to exist: removed from the stack and put nowhere (it isn't a card,
  [CR#701.6a]). `engine-resolve-actions` left this a narrowed `todo!` in
  `Action::Counter` (the spell arm → owner's graveyard is live). Wants a
  cessation path distinct from `AbilityResolved` — a countered ability did NOT
  resolve — that does the same `remove_stack_entry` + discard-the-minted-token
  with no zone move. Completes ward's verb (`Counter` targets a spell OR an
  ability).
- [ ] `engine-resolve-effects` — May, If/Unless, ForEach, Modal, Delayed,
  Reflexive effect frames; resolution-time choices surfaced as decisions.
- [ ] `engine-resolve-count-x` — `Count::X`: announced at cast/activate
  ([CR#107.3a]), stored on the stack entry, read back in `eval_count`.
  Sequence after `engine-deontic-polarities` (the announce slot lives in
  cast.rs). Smaller leftover seams from `engine-resolve-counts` (landed:
  CountOf/StatOf/ThatMuch): Loyalty/Defense `StatOf` reads (counter
  machinery), and the trigger-bound `ThatMuch` magnitude (needs a
  `TriggerBindings` slot — trigger.rs, after `engine-trigger-events`).
- [ ] `engine-resolve-selections` — Choose/Random selections as surfaced
  decisions; remaining `Reference` variants (Bound, Linked, ControllerOf,
  OwnerOf, attachment refs).
- [ ] `engine-filter-breadth` — evaluate Named, Stat, Relation (controller/owner/
  opponent/attached), StateFilter (Status, RelatedBy, Targets/TargetCount),
  and Ref(Reference) filters (`target.rs`, `trigger.rs` snapshot matching).
  `HasCounter` and `Designated` read live since P0.W5/W6.

### Triggers and conditions (`trigger.rs`)

- [x] `engine-trigger-events` — cause-pattern matching (verb/agency/agent —
  `Destroyed` and the sacrificed/discarded/played views narrow live),
  Performed (Cast + DealDamage facts; Sacrifice/Discard/Play cause views,
  performer = the mover), becomes-tapped/untapped (effect emitters
  transition-guarded; the attack tap emits its cause-tagged fact),
  becomes-blocked (once-per-attacker scan dedup), becomes-targeted (the
  announce lock emits `BecameTarget`; ward's trigger half), OneOf,
  ControlledBy, game-scope DesignationChanged; composite keywords flatten
  into the trigger ability space (prowess live e2e). Residual seams:
  phased/turned-face/object-designation deltas await their fact shapes,
  `DamageDealt` has no combat coordinate yet ("combat damage" triggers),
  Performed verbs outside the wired set trip, and ward's by-row keys on
  stack-zone state an ability announce can't satisfy until promote.
- [ ] `engine-trigger-conditions` — Condition::Is, Compare, Happened; intervening
  "if" rechecked on resolution [CR#603.4].
- [ ] `engine-trigger-limits` — OncePerTurn and friends.
- [x] `engine-history-tallies` — turn/game history the condition layer can query:
  spells cast this turn (storm), lands played, life lost/gained, permanents
  that left, "entered this turn", attack/cast ordinals. The Tallies registry
  exists; wire it broadly and extend `Window` beyond ThisTurn.
  Engine evaluation landed + unit-tested (history log; `Condition::Happened`
  for ThisTurn/ThisGame; `Count::Query` for storm/lands/draws/life [CR#608.2i]).
  No e2e: no canon card or parser path emits the history grammar yet — that
  rides the parser keyword work (storm, below) and ability-word parsing
  (morbid/raid, [CR#207.2c]).
- [ ] `engine-history-filtered-counts` — a `Count` form for filtered historical
  counts over the history log ("draw a card for each creature that died this
  turn"). The `engine-history-tallies` log already retains the data; this is the
  new grammar variant + eval arm, and wants its own design dialogue (object
  cardinality vs. event tally vs. this).
- [ ] `engine-history-tallies-cache` — optimization pass: reconstruct O(1) cached
  counters for hot history queries (lands/draws/storm) on top of the
  `engine-history-tallies` log, which stays the source of truth. Deferred from
  that slice (deleted the old `Tally` struct rather than keep dual bookkeeping).

### Layers and continuous effects (`layer.rs` seams)

- [/] `engine-layers-1-3` — layer 1 copy, layer 2 control change, layer 3 text
  change; face-down characteristics; dependency ordering [CR#613.8].
- [ ] `engine-layers-misc` — condition evaluation on static abilities, Of/These
  scope resolution (currently locked empty), subtype changes in layer 4 with
  confers data (incl. changeling's `AllCreatureTypes` fill — the
  kw-changeling seam), become-basic-land-type, base loyalty/defense.

### SBAs and counters (`sba.rs`)

- [ ] `engine-sba-breadth` — the remaining [CR#704.5] sweeps (poison landed in
  P0.W6, live off the proxy counter map): toughness ≤ 0, loyalty 0, illegal
  auras, unattached-equipment legality, legend rule, battle with no defense,
  spell-copy cleanup. (Token-ceases already sweeps.)
- [ ] `engine-counters-api` — apply the counter events (verbs/events landed in
  P0.W3; storage already lives on objects, players via their proxy);
  enters-with-counters; +1/+1 vs −1/−1 annihilation SBA; keyword-counter
  payload registry [CR#122.1] (stun, shield, finality, flying, …).

### Replacements and prevention (`replace.rs`)

- [ ] `engine-replacements` — a general replacement registry beyond enters-tapped:
  Instead/Skip/Also, zone-destination redirects, enters-with-counters,
  enters-as-choices, draw replacements (dredge/miracle window), dies→exile,
  lifegain/damage modification, self-replacement ordering. The destruction
  hook is already live: `engine-resolve-actions` routes both destroy paths
  through the replaceable `WillDestroy` intent, and its apply handles
  indestructible inline (replace-with-nothing, [CR#702.12b]). What this item
  adds for destruction is APPLYING a non-trivial destroy-replacement at that
  hook: regeneration's one-shot, turn-scoped shield ("the next time ~ would be
  destroyed this turn, instead tap it, remove it from combat, heal all
  damage") — including the `regenerate` effect/keyword-action that sets the
  shield — and umbra-armor/totem-armor (`Umbra armor`, §6: destroy the Aura +
  heal instead).
- [ ] `engine-prevention` — prevention shields and windows [CR#615.1], including
  "can't be prevented".

### Costs and casting (`cast.rs`, `legal.rs`)

- [x] `engine-deontic-polarities` — evaluate the deontic rows still behind
  the narrowed presence guards: `May(Cast(window: InstantSpeed))` lifts in
  `can_cast` (flash [CR#702.8a], canon Pouncing Cheetah),
  `Must(Attack/Block)` requirements at declaration submission
  ([CR#508.1d,509.1c], canon Goblin Brigand / Taunting Elf),
  `Must(Target)` at target-choice submission ([CR#601.2c] Flagbearer
  class, canon Standard Bearer; `target::matches` gained the Subtype
  arm), and the announce-time targeting-object seam (activations mint
  their stack identity at `begin_activate` per [CR#602.2a]). Remaining
  guards = May/Gate Attack/Block/Target polarities, non-flash Cast
  shapes (`from`/`cost` slots — the `engine-alt-costs` /
  `engine-cast-from-zones` unlocks), and Play/Attach rows; the
  requirement×bound and conflicting-requirement maximize arbitration
  stays a LOUD in-evaluation seam ([CR#509.1c]'s menace example), as
  does a Must(Target) row matching a placing trigger (`by` can't exempt
  triggers yet). Goad rides the Must(Attack) evaluation once designation
  payloads flow into the derived view.

- [ ] `engine-x-costs` — X announcement, X in effects, zero-X edge cases.
- [ ] `engine-cost-payment` — hybrid/Phyrexian payment choices, snow, life
  payment, non-mana additional costs (sacrifice/discard/exile/tap others).
- [ ] `engine-cost-modification` — apply CostModifier statics in the cost
  calculation pipeline [CR#601.2f] (affinity, convoke, improvise, delve,
  reducers/taxers).
- [ ] `engine-alt-costs` — choosing an alternative cost at announcement; "without
  paying its mana cost" (cascade, suspend, plot).
- [x] `engine-activated-abilities` — activating non-mana abilities (only mana
  abilities are legal today, `legal.rs`): general costs, timing restrictions
  ("only as a sorcery", once-per-turn, once-per-game), loyalty abilities.
- [ ] `engine-mana-system` — mana pool provenance/riders (spend-only-on
  restrictions, doesn't-empty), triggered mana abilities, conditional
  production.
- [ ] `engine-cast-from-zones` — casting from graveyard/exile/library via
  permissions; linked "the exiled card" access; timing windows (miracle,
  forecast).

### Zones and objects

- [ ] `engine-attach` — the attachment relation behind the `Attach` verb's
  seam: storage on objects, `Attach` resolution ([CR#701.3a..701.3b] —
  no-op on illegal/duplicate attach), enchant/equip attach-legality via
  the `Cant(Attach)` rows, and the illegal-attachment sweeps
  ([CR#704.5m..704.5n]); takes Equip and Enchant end-to-end with the
  Aura-targeting half already live.

- [ ] `engine-exile-command` — wire Exile (face-up/face-down, with counters,
  linked retrieval) and Command zones as zone-pipeline sources/destinations.
- [x] `engine-tokens` — resolve Create; token objects on the battlefield; token
  copies; predefined tokens (Treasure, Food, Clue, Blood, Map, Powerstone,
  Incubator, Role); token SBA on zone leave.
- [ ] `engine-copy-spells` — spell copies on the stack with target re-choice
  (storm, replicate, casualty, conspire, magecraft sources).
- [ ] `engine-attachments` — attach/unattach state, enchant/equip legality
  checks, aura cast targeting, attach SBAs, equip/reconfigure/fortify
  activation.
- [ ] `engine-face-down` — face-down spells and permanents (morph/disguise/
  manifest/cloak), turn-face-up special action, face-down exile.
- [ ] `engine-planeswalkers` — loyalty enters/activation/SBA, attacking
  planeswalkers (attack-target choice), compleated.
- [ ] `engine-battles` — defense counters, protector designation, attacking
  battles, defeated trigger + back-face casting.
- [ ] `engine-sagas` — lore counters, chapter firing, final-chapter sacrifice,
  read-ahead.
- [ ] `engine-transform` — transforming DFC permanents (front/back face state,
  transforms-with-day-night, meld pairs).
- [ ] `engine-phasing` — phasing status and untap-step phasing events.

### Combat

- [ ] `engine-combat-restrictions` — enforce evasion/restriction statics in
  attack/block legality: flying/reach, menace, fear/intimidate/shadow/skulk,
  landwalk, defender, "can't attack/block", protection-from in blocking.
- [ ] `engine-combat-requirements` — must-attack/must-block requirements, goad,
  attack taxes/costs.
- [ ] `engine-multi-defender` — attack targets per attacker (player, planeswalker,
  battle) and per-defender damage routing.

### Turn, game, determinism

- [ ] `engine-turn-modification` — extra turns, extra combat/main phases, skip
  steps/phases, "end the turn".
- [ ] `engine-win-alterations` — can't-lose/can't-win statics, alternate win/loss
  effects, restart-the-game, controlling another player's turn. **[design]**
- [ ] `engine-randomness` — seeded shuffle, coin flips, random discard; keep runs
  reproducible for the sim harness.

## 4. Card shapes (layouts)

Extraction currently reads `normal` and `modal_dfc` only; each row needs
grammar (§2 `core-card-shapes`), extraction, and engine behavior. Slug:
`shape-<layout>`.

| Layout | Modern cards | Work |
|---|---|---|
| transform | 365 | two faces + transform lifecycle (`engine-transform`) |
| saga | 106 | chapters (`core-saga-chapters`, `engine-sagas`) |
| modal_dfc | 93 | grammar done; engine play-either-face + back-face casting rules |
| adventure | 102 | second spell face + exile-then-cast-creature state |
| split | 80 | two halves; fuse; characteristics on the stack |
| reversible_card | 56 | cosmetic duplicate — normalize to the real layout |
| prepare | 36 | paired prepare/instant face (TLA) |
| mutate | 30 | merged-permanent stacks **[design]** |
| class | 27 | level designations + paid level-up statics |
| aftermath | 26 | split with graveyard-castable half |
| leveler | 25 | level counters + level-band characteristics |
| meld | 21 | two cards → one melded back face |
| flip | 20 | single card, flipped half (Kamigawa style) |
| prototype | 19 | alternate cost/characteristics while casting |
| case | 12 | Case enchantments: solve condition + solved state |

## 5. Game-wide systems

- [ ] `noncanon-keyword-decks` — grow the noncanon matchup decks with the
  now-live keywords (fliers/reach, menace, defender, hexproof) so the
  50-game gate regression-tests keyword interactions systemically, not
  just per-test. Lives in the noncanon workspace/feature.

- [ ] `engine-day-night` — day/night game state, daybound/nightbound transforms
  (~236 cards).
- [ ] `engine-dungeons` — dungeon objects outside the game, venture, room
  progression, completion (76 cards).
- [ ] `engine-energy` — {E} energy counters on players (105 cards).
- [ ] `engine-ring` — the Ring emblem and tempts-you progression (50 cards).
- [ ] `engine-speed` — speed counters, start-your-engines, max speed (~97 cards).
- [ ] `engine-citys-blessing` — ascend / city's blessing designation (71 cards).
- [ ] `engine-poison` — poison counters, infect/toxic/corrupted hooks, poison SBA
  (~190 cards).
- [ ] `engine-party` — party count condition (5 cards).

## 6. Keyword abilities

any engine machinery (right column names the §3 item it rides on), parser
coverage, and graduating its cards. Slug: `kw-<kebab-case>`.

## 8. Ability words

Ability words carry no rules weight; the work is (a) one umbrella parser item
and (b) the condition/history machinery the marked abilities lean on (mostly
`engine-history-tallies`, `engine-trigger-events`, `engine-trigger-conditions`).
Rows here track that the *patterns* graduate. Slug: `aw-<kebab-case>`.

- [ ] `aw-prefix-parsing` — strip "Ability word —" prefixes during extraction and
  preserve them for rendering.

## 9. Pipeline and parsers

- [x] `parser-keyword-arg-breadth` — keyword-line argument shapes beyond
  single quality words and pure-mana costs: compound qualities
  ("protection from everything", "from artifacts", multi-quality "from
  red and from white" [CR#702.16g]), non-mana keyword costs
  ("Ward—Pay 3 life.", "Cycling—Discard a card."), and variable costs
  ("Ward {X}"). Still declined (parse-filters territory): or-costs
  ("Pay {3} or discard a card"), sacrifice-a-[filter] costs, cost riders
  ("at random"), compound type qualities ("from artifacts and
  enchantments", "from monocolored").
- [ ] `macro-bare-defaulted-invocations` — let a bare macro name read as a
  zero-arg invocation when every param is defaulted (`Hexproof` vs
  today's required `Hexproof()`); needs a probe-free path through serde's
  one-shot `VariantAccess` (or a macro-layer pre-scan), which is why the
  parser currently owns the convention instead.

- [x] `parse-activated` — activated-ability frame (`cost: effect`), including the
  cost grammar; registry slot exists, parser doesn't.
- [ ] `parse-static` — static-prose abilities (gets/has/can't sentences) into
  Continuously/StaticEffect.
- [ ] `parse-replacement` — "if … would …, instead …" / "as … enters" /
  "… enters tapped" templates.
- [ ] `parse-modal` — "Choose one —" bullet lists, escalate/spree-style modal
  costs.
- [ ] `parse-filters` — natural-language object descriptions to Filter ASTs
  beyond the current handful (control/zone/type/stat qualifiers).
- [ ] `macro-keyword-templates` — template parameters for keyword macros
  (ward cost, protection quality, typed cycling) so the ~190 keyword stubs
  can expand per-card.
- [x] `macro-subtype-params` — subtype macro registers under its printed-string
  argument, not its filename; parametric subtype refs miss it and their cards
  stall as todos. Needs the template-param refactor.
- [ ] `macro-keyword-actions` — implement the 66 keyword-action macro stubs over
  engine primitives.
- [ ] `pipeline-fixpoint` — dependency-ordered re-graduation (subtypes → keywords
  → cards) instead of today's single pass.
- [ ] `pipeline-layout-extraction` — extract layouts beyond normal/modal_dfc
  (see §4).
- [ ] `canon-slice` — grow `plugins/canon/` toward the ~100–200-card mechanics
  slice (`card-data.md`): as each mechanic lands, graduate a few real cards
  exercising it; hand-write (and mark) the genuinely unparseable ones.
- [ ] `macro-param-validation` — type-check macro params (Color, Filter, …) at
  the graduate gate.
- [ ] `tokens-templates` — token definitions (predefined + ad-hoc) and granted
  quoted abilities; resume from the parked bookmarks (§1). **[design]**

## 10. Format and runner

- [ ] `format-deck-validation` — Modern deck legality: banlist via mtgjson
  legalities (derived data only), 4-of rule, sideboard size.
- [ ] `runner-outside-game` — sideboard/outside-the-game access (companion,
  Lesson fetch, wish-style effects).
- [ ] `runner-hidden-info` — per-player redaction stays a runner-layer projection
  by design (core is full-information). The face-down mechanics in §6 are the
  forcing function; revisit the boundary then. **[design]**
